# NiceLLM: A Python LLM toolkit

## About

NiceLLM is a Python package that homologates mainstream library functions of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as OpenAI and Google Generative AI, into a unique and simple interface for the user.

## Main Features

- Simplified handling of API connections
- Simplified interface to use images in the prompt

## Installation

The source code can be found at https://github.com/idealab-udec/nicellm.

```
pip install nicellm
```

## Initial config

To initialize the functions of `nicellm`, you will need to set some environment variables, which will contain the API keys for OpenAI and Google Generative AI. We suggest to create a file called `.env` in your root folder with the following information:

```
APIKEY_GOOGLE="YOUR-API-KEY-FROM-GENERATIVE-AI"
APIKEY_OPENAI="YOUR-API-KEY-FROM-OPEN-AI"
```

It is not mandatory to set up both variables. However, you must set up at least the one corresponding to the models you want to use.

Then, executing `. .env` to make sure that those variables are config.

## Usage

Interact with `gpt-3.5-turbo`:

```
import nicellm as llm

llm.get_response(
    model_id="gpt-3.5-turbo",
    prompt="Who is the best LLM in the world?"
)
```

The same question can be easily replicated using `gemini-pro`:

```
llm.get_response(
    model_id="gemini-pro",
    prompt="Who is the best LLM in the world?"
)
```
